software development cycle:
code - build - test - realease - deploy - || operate - monitor - plan

1. CI/CD:

      1.1 CI: Continuous Integration  持续集成
          send the code to the main codebase and small maintainable chunks automatically tested against the main codebase. [merge code in mian code]

          Test (github actions: unit testing, validation testing, format testing)
          Build - unit test
          Release - integration test, UI test 

      1.2 CD: Continuous Delpoyment   持续交付
          [release code out]
      

      CI/CD helps test new code.

      1.3 Why use it?
      Automate not Manually
      Avoid technical debt - 越后面麻烦越多
